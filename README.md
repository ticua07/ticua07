- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m ticua07
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working with back-end technologies like Flask and also front-end with React
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) <i>as my skills aren't good enough still to make a website without Bootstrap nor Google ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“</i> - 31/7/2022: Update: My skills as well as my confidence have improved a lot!
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Discord, as `Ticua#3251` or send me an email at `ticua@ticua.ar` (Expect for response to be late, I don't check my email that much)
